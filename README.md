# Marketing Experimentation & Store Testing –– Physical Stores

This repository contains deliverables from **semi-randomized experiments** -when a randomized setup is not feasible- evaluating marketing interventions and operational changes.

## **Semi-randomized: Store testing analysis with Synthetic Control Method(SCM)**  

The goal of these experiments is to measure the impact of interventions in physical stores using the **Synthetic Control Method (SCM)**. This framework moves decision-making from intuition-based to **evidence-driven**, providing actionable insights for retail growth.
- Marketing tests conducted in physical convenience stores, 7-Eleven and Pressbyrån.  
- Analyzed using **Synthetic Control Method (SCM)** to measure the true effect of interventions in a semi randomized setup.  
- Includes structured planning tools, method documentation, workflows, and R code to support experiment design, execution, and analysis.


## Objectives

- Measure the impact of store-level interventions on sales, customer behavior, or operational metrics.
- Apply structured, data-driven experimentation to reduce bias from seasonality, trends, or external noise.
- Provide a replicable framework for planning, executing, and evaluating in-store tests.

## What’s Included

- **Method Description:** PDF detailing the SCM framework, step-by-step store test execution, and evaluation strategy.
- **Step_by_Step_Guidance:** Visual Guidance mind map of running an experiment in a semi randomized retail setup.
- **Testing_Methods:** Visual representation of different experimentation methods and workflows.
- **[Planning Tool](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nlxEjyWH7uzx1KbdqwYSVwptr1H5RO1JU0_s5cWQQ8s/edit?usp=sharing) :** Excel-based relational planner for defining, scheduling, and tracking store experiments.
- **Code Base:** R scripts to implement SCM models, compute True Lift, and generate results. (In Prosress)
- **Results:** Sample outputs demonstrating application of SCM to store tests.
